# Viafly

### Demo

npm install, then run 'nodemon start'

open up localhost:1337

Type in bar to search, click on column titles to sort

### Choices

I used Express, AngularJS, and Node because I've used these before at Fullstack Academy. These are what allow me to send information to the browser

### Future Version

In the future, I would want to add a button that imports any CSV. This would mean that I would have to send data back to my backend and change my HTML file to be more flexible (allow different columns)
